# Basic Clustering
This project deals with finding patterns in daily commute record. For this project we created our own dataset using app SensorLog. Then we applied clustering techniques to find out patterns. This technique can be used in building tracking system for Dementia patients. When person moves out of daily commute cluster, system should be able to tigger about deviation.
